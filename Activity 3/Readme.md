Use Bascinet (Bascinet is a GUI front-end that has been developed for the TL System) for this activity.<br>
This activity holds the construct of TL domain for the language to be developed.<br>
TL domain will allow to parse programs in your language, check for the presence of ambiguously defined constructs, view the parse tree corresponding to programs, and output the parse tree to a file.<br>
Also, a sample Java program is given, which has to be tranformed into the syntax of the language to be developed and must be tested for the parsing.
