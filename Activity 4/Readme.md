This is the final developed model for the programming language which is activated through Bascinet.<br>
In this activity, I wrote a denotational-semantic based interpreter for the language to be developed, which written in ML and integrated with the TL system.<br>
Also contain a TL domain in which the interpreter for your language is integrated.
